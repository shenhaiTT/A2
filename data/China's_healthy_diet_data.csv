CoHD,Cost of a healthy diet,"The cost of a healthy diet indicator is the cost of purchasing the least expensive locally available foods to meet requirements for energy and food-based dietary guidelines (FBDG) for a representative person within energy balance at 2330 kcal/day. The cost of a healthy diet is converted to international dollars using purchasing power parity (PPP). Data are available for 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022. PPP conversion factors are imputed by the FAO for years not available in the WDI database. PPPs are imputed in one or multiple years for the following countries: Angola, Argentina, Aruba, Bermuda, British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Curaçao, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Dominica, Eswatini, Kazakhstan, Lebanon, Liberia, Myanmar,  Seychelles, Sint Maarten (Dutch part), Suriname, Tajikistan and Zimbabwe.

For Bahamas, Guyana, Haiti, Iran, Myanmar, Sint Maarten (Dutch Part), and Turks and Caicos Islands, retail food prices were not available from the ICP 2021. As a result, the CoHD for these countries is calculated using data from the ICP 2017 for the period from 2017 to 2022.","Adapted from Herforth, A., Venkat, A., Bai, Y., Costlow, L., Holleman, C. & Masters, W.A. 2022.

CoHD_pov,Affordability of a healthy diet: ratio of cost to the food poverty line,"The ratio of the cost of a healthy diet to the food poverty lines, defined as $1.35/day for low-income countries (63% of the international poverty line of $2.15/day in 2017 PPP$), $2.04/day for lower-middle-income countries (56% of the international poverty line of $3.65/day in 2017 PPP$), $3.15/day for upper-middle-income countries (46% of the international poverty line of $6.85/day in 2017 PPP$), and $11.2/day (46% of the international poverty line of $24.36/day in 2017 PPP$). The percentages (63%, 56%, and 46%) represent the average food expenditure shares in the second quintile of consumers in low-income and lower-middle-income countries, and the first quintile of consumers in upper-middle-and-high-income countries, according to household surveys compiled by the World Bank. Countries' income classifications follow the calendar year of 2021 standard (fiscal year of 2023 of the World Bank), which is the base year of the latest ICP cycle. Data available for 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022.","Adapted from Herforth, A., Venkat, A., Bai, Y., Costlow, L., Holleman, C. & Masters, W.A. 2022.

CoHD_headcount,Prevalence of unaffordability of a healthy diet,"The indicator estimates the percentage of individuals in a population whose disposable income, net of the amount needed to acquire basic non-food goods and services, is lower than the average cost of the least-expensive healthy diet in a country. The expenditures for basic non-food needs are calculated as average non-food expenditure shares of low-income consumers multiplied by international poverty lines set by the World Bank. The non-food expenditure share is 37% and 44% in low-income and lower-middle-income countries for the second quintile of consumers, and 54% in upper-middle-and-high-income countries for the first quintile of consumers, according to recent household surveys for 71 countries compiled by the World Bank. The international poverty lines are $2.15/day for low-income countries, $3.65/day for lower-middle-income countries, $6.85/day for upper-middle-income countries, and $24.36/day for high-income countries, in 2017PPP$. Countries' income classifications follow the calendar year of 2021 standard (fiscal year of 2023 of the World Bank), which is the base year of the latest ICP cycle. Income data are provided by the World Bank’s Poverty and Inequality Platform. A value of zero indicates a null or a small number rounded down at the current precision level. Data available for 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022.

National income distribution data are provided by the World Bank’s Poverty and Inequality Platform and are based on 2017 purchasing power parities (PPPs), updated in fall 2024.","Adapted from Herforth, A., Venkat, A., Bai, Y., Costlow, L., Holleman, C. & Masters, W.A. 2022.
